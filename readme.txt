Abstract

A study group is an online discussion forum where students hold conversations on a particular posted topics among their group, as well as the whole class. There are various discussion forums which are already existing online. These groups have various motivational factors which aids the users to participate more actively in these forums. But, these kind of forums focus only on the individual performance and leaves out group performance. The inhibitions of students who feel a lot of pressure to participate and compete among a group of well performing students are ignored in most of these forums. Our study groups tries to addresses these issues. We focus more on ‘motivation’ and ‘social ties in private groups’ which aids the students to participate more effectively in a larger discussion group. We give rankings not just for individual users, but also ‘groups’ which motivates users to participate well as a group.
